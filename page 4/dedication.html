Instead it is brushed away as something for the "weak" or the "dramtaic". However mental health is a real thing, and it is a part of all of us-whether you realize it or not. We presented "Signs of a Sinking Ship" because it's about time we give mental health its long overdue discussion. </h2><br></div>
