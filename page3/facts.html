        <div class="causes"><h1>Causes of Stress in Teens</h1><br>Teen stress can be caused by a myriad  of things; however, it should be noted that the issues that will be specifically focused on will involve stress in relation to school.<br><br>
            According to American Psychological Association for the Stress in America Survey, 
            <em>83% of teenagers report school as a source of their stress.</em> But what are the reasons behind that stress?<br><br> In today's day and age, pressures to perform well in highschool are at an all time high. The most notable colleges expect students to maintain straight A's and have a plethora of after school activites and partake in volunteer work. These expectations to perform exceedingly well and still have a social life are on spevific cause of highschool stress. <br><br>According to USA Today, <em>59% of teens report that managing their time to balance all activities being a stressor</em>. In addition to that, students are constantly being told that after highschool they experience "the real world". And according to USA Today, <em>69% report the uncertainty of their future after highschool being a source of their stress (ie: having to choose a college).</em></div> <br>
        <div class="effects"><h1>Effects of Stress in Teens</h1>The effects of stress vary drastically from person to person. Anger,Anxiety, and even depression can be potential consequences of stress.<br><br> USA Today reports that <em>40% of teens feel irrationally angry</em> and <em>36% feel extreme nervousness and anger.</em> <em>1/3 say stress makes them feel overwhelmed, depressed, or sad.</em> And emotional impacts aren't the only ones. <br><br> <em>40%  of teens say they neglected responsibilities at home because of stress.</em><br> <em>21% of teens say they neglected work or school because of stress.</em><br>
            <em>32% of teens say they experience headaches because of stress.</em><br> <em>26% report changes in sleeping habits.</em><br>
            <em>26% report snapping at or being short with classmates or teammates when under stress.</em><br> <em>35% of teens report a loss of sleep. </em> <br> <em>26 % of teens overeating or eating unhealthy foods.</em><br> <em>23% of teens  skipping meals due to stress in the past month.</em><br><br> The report warns that teens are at risk of a variety of physical and emotional ills and potentially shorter lifespans than their elders if they don't act to <em>"reverse their current trajectory of chronic illness, poor health and shorter lifespans."</em><br></div> 
        <div class="solution"><h1>How YOU Can Help</h1>

USA today stated that <em>"Despite anecdotal reports of high stress, researchers say stress itself in adolescents hasn't been studied broadly; global comparisons have focused on adult stress rather than teens."</em><br> They go on to state the following warning signs: <br><br>"<em>Emotional changes:</em> Your teen might appear agitated, anxious, and/or depressed. Pay attention to changes in behavior.<br><br>
            <em>Physical changes: </em> Teens under stress are likely to get sick more often and complain of headaches, stomachaches, and other aches and pains.<br><br>
            <em>Behavioral changes: </em>Look for changes in eating or sleeping habits, and avoidance of normal daily activities.<br><br>
            <em>Cognitive changes: </em> You might notice decreased concentration, forgetfulness, and/or the appearance of carelessness."<br><br> <em>Be apart of the coversation; not a cause of silence. Reach out and be there for those who need it most.</em>
